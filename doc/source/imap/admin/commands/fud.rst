Provide information about user mailboxes

Synopsis

.. parsed-literal::

    **fud** [ **-C** *config-file* ] [ **-U** *uses* ] [ **-T** *timeout* ] [ **-D** ]

Description
===========

**fud** is a long lived datagram daemon started from master that
provides information about when a user last read their mail, when mail
last arrived in a user's mailbox, and how many messages are recent for
that user.

Note that for **fud** to run properly you must set ``proto=udp`` in its
:manpage:`cyrus.conf(5)` services entry.  ``prefork=1`` is also
recommended.

**fud** will automatically proxy any and all FUD requests to the
appropriate backend server if it is runing on a Cyrus Murder frontend
machine.

Options

    The maximum number of times that the process should be used for new
    connections before shutting down.  The default is 250.

.. option:: -T  timeout

    The number of seconds that the process will wait for a new
    connection before shutting down.  Note that a value of 0 (zero)
    will disable the timeout.  The default is 60.

Bugs
====

Though not really a bug, **fud** will silently ignore any requests that
it does not consider valid.

Also not really a bug, **fud** requires that the anonymous user has the
0 (zero) right on the mailbox in question.  This is only a "bug" because
0 is not a standard IMAP ACL bit.

**fud** is an experimental interface meant to provide information to
build a finger-like service around.  Eventually it should be superceded
by a more standards-based protocol.
