intro

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

    **mbtool** [ **-C** *config-file* ] **-t** *mailboxes*...

Description
===========

**mbtool** is a tool for performing various actions on the indexes of a
list of mailboxes. The only action currently supported is **-t**, which
will normalize the ``internaldate`` time stamp of each record in the
index to GMT.

It is intended that **mbtool** will be extended over time to perform
more such actions.

**mbtool** |default-conf-text|

Options
=======

.. program:: mbtool

.. option:: -C config-file

    |cli-dash-c-text|

.. option:: -t

    Normalize ``internaldate`` on all index records of all listed
    *mailbox*\ es to match the *Date:* header if they're off by more
    than a day, which can be used to fix up a mailbox which has been
    restored from backup and lost its internaldate information.

Examples
========

.. parsed-literal::

    **mbtool -t** user.jsmith

..

        Normalize ``internaldate`` on all index records in 
        *user.jsmith*.
