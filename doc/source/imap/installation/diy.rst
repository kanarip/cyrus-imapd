==============
Do It Yourself
==============

The following guides outline building Cyrus IMAP from a fresh clone of
the GIT repository's branches, or a tarball of a released version.

.. WARNING::

    The level of technical difficulty involved with home-brew or DIY
    Cyrus IMAP versions is **high**.

    You are specifically requested **not** to build your own unless you
    have an appropriate comprehension of dependencies and building those
    yourself if you have to.

From GIT
========

Clone the GIT repository:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :command:`git clone https://git.cyrus.foundation/diffusion/I/cyrus-imapd.git`

Check out the desired branch or revision:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :command:`git branch -la`
    * master
      (...snip...)
      remotes/origin/cyrus-imapd-2.3
      remotes/origin/cyrus-imapd-2.4
      remotes/origin/cyrus-imapd-2.5
    $ :command:`git checkout` *$branch*

Continue with :ref:`imap-installation-diy-build-dependencies`.

From Tarball
============

Download the `latest stable tarball`_ : version |imap_current_stable_version|.

Extract the tarball:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ :command:`tar xzvf cyrus-imapd-x.y.z.tar.gz`
	
.. _latest stable tarball: ftp://ftp.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/

Build Dependencies
==================

If you run an operating system or Linux distribution that already
includes packages for Cyrus IMAP, then the build dependencies for
Cyrus IMAP are specified in the packaging specification for that
package.

To install build dependencies on a Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux or
CentOS system for example, you can run the following commands:

.. parsed-literal::

    # :command:`yum install yum-utils`
    # :command:`yum-builddep cyrus-imapd`

Consult the upstream documentation of your platform for further
information on the availability of such commands and their usage.
