Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.1.5

*   Better locking of the mailbox list during mupdate operations for CREATE and RENAME
*   Permissions fixes for annotations.
*   pop3proxyd now does telemetry logging
*   Cleanup a number of leaks in the murder code
*   Correct semantics of our provided strlcpy(). Fix places where strlcpy() was being used incorrectly.

*   OpenSSL is now handled correctly for the perl modules
*   Small documentation cleanups
*   The normal assortment of small bugfixes

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.1.4

*   Sieve is no longer dependent on duplicate delivery suppression (it still uses the duplicate delivery database however).
*   Sieve now supports draft-segmuller-sieve-relation-02.txt
*   imtest now includes all the functionality previously kept in pop3test, lmtptest, smtptest, and mupdatetest. imtest will notice if it is invoked with one of these names and do the right thing. The -P flag can be used to force a particular protocol. As part of this, the default install location for mupdatetest has changed to be the same as the other test utilities. imtest also includes new MANAGESIEVE functionality (sivtest) as well as the ability to reconnect to the same server multiple times (useful for testing SSL/TLS session caching and DIGEST-MD5 fast reauth).
*   snmpgen generates stubbed out code so we don't waste resources on something that just doesn't work. At some point in time, we'll make it work again as it would be useful to gather aggregate statistics on what commands are being used so we can better tune the server. This change closes bug #1191. New bug 1267 opened to re-enable the feature.
*   Added the chk_cyrus program to help point out missing message files and/or mailboxes
*   ANNOTATEMORE improvements. Server annotation support has been added. We are also now using the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd hierarchy. The "info" command in cyradm now returns annotations for the given mailbox (provided that ANNOTATEMORE support is compiled into the server)
*   The RENAME command has been almost entirely rewritten. Now we rely on mailbox-level locking instead of locking the entire mailboxes file for the duration of the rename. ctl_cyrusdb -r now also cleans up "reserved" mailboxes that may appear in the event of a crash.
*   ctl_mboxlist can now dump only a particular partition
*   The configuration subsystem now uses a hash table to speed up lookups of options. Additionally, the hash table implementation has been updated to possibly take advantage of memory pools.
*   Many bugfixes related to the Cyrus Murder. Includes improvments to subscription handling as well as correct merging of seen state on mailbox moves.
*   Can now configure an external debugger (debug_command option in imapd.conf.
*   Misc. autoconf-related fixes (most notably those related to sasl_checkapop and O_DSYNC).
*   Misc. locking-related fixes.
*   Security fixes related to handling large literals in getxstring(), as well as correct usage of layers in timsieved.

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.1.3

*   All "MAIL" and "SIEVE" notifications are now handled by notifyd which is a daemon that supports multiple notification methods. The mailnotifier and sievenotifier options have been added to /etc/imapd.conf to configure notifications. (Ken Murchison)
*   Many feature enhancements and bugfixes for the Cyrus Murder. The code now supports live (but not transparent) moving of mailboxes from one server to another.
*   Some warning fixes.
*   fdatasync() is no longer required.
*   Fixed a bug in imap/append.c that would show itself if a message was being delivered to five or more different partitions.
*   Deliveries now don't create a redudant temporary file using tmpfile(); the staging directory is used instead. (Ken Murchison)
*   Fix a possible crashing bug in squatter. (Ken Murchison)
*   Deleting a user now also removes their Sieve scripts.
*   cyrusdb_skiplist: release locks during iteration. Should prevent denial of service attacks and possibly increase performance.
*   cyrusdb_skiplist: introduce a new mode using O_DSYNC writes which is possibly faster on Solaris. Currently off (it seems to hurt performance on Linux).
*   master has preliminary code to avoid forking storms.
*   sieveshell should now loop through all available SASL mechanisms before conceding defeat.
*   sieveshell can now upload a file to a different name.

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.1.2

*   fud now runs from the Cyrus master process; more generally, the Cyrus master process can deal with UDP services. (Amos Gouaux, amos@utdallas.edu)
*   Sieve has been updated to be compliant with RFC 3028 and draft-martin-sieve-notify-01. All notify actions and any fileinto and/or redirect actions using stringlists will have to be updated/changed.

*   fixed a bug in the Sieve header cache, where legal header names were being rejected.
*   many Murder-related fixes
*   suppress a bogus TLS session reuse DBERROR message
*   make the list of acceptable TLS ciphers configurable in /etc/imapd.conf
*   cyrusdb_skiplist fixes; it's now suitable for using in production environments though there are still performance problems outstanding

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.1.1

*   Warning-related bug fixes from Henrique de Moras Holschuh hmh@debian.org
*   automatic archival of db3 files so that filesystem backups are always consistent (Ken Murchison, ken@oceana.com)
*   added a skiplist database backend, still needs more testing
*   further work on the Cyrus Murder
*   fixed bug in remotepurge dealing with mailboxes with characters that need to be escaped inside quoted-strings
*   Cyrus::IMAP::Admin now supports referrals
*   cyradm, via Cyrus::IMAP::Shell, now can remove quotaroots
