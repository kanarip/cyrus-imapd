Cyrus IMAP 2.3.14 Release Notes
===============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.3.13

*   Fixed incompatibility between older ManageSieve clients and newer servers that issue an auto-capability response after AUTH with a SASL security layer.
*   Fixed quota calculation to ignore files not mentioned in the index
*   Correct cache truncation after an aborted append (was leaving empty holes in the cache file>)
*   Fixed ACLs copying when renaming users
*   Fixed TLS session reuse
*   Log more detail about changes done by a reconstruct (indicating that there were problems with the mailbox before hand - mainly as a debugging aid)
*   Ensured that the longest possible named mailbox can still be deleted when delayed delete is enabled by increasing buffer sizes
*   Add configuration option mailbox_default_options allowing (for example) modsequences to be turned on for all new mailboxes
*   Replication:
*       added -R option to sync_client to do rolling replication in the foreground (to run under supervise or similar)
*       made cyr_synclog run as cyrus user if started as root
*       Changed ADDSUB/DELSUB replication to replicate current state rather than log explicit changes, avoiding a bug where if multiple subscription changes happened in one sync run, the replica could be incorrect
*       Changed replication logging related to user creation and mailboxes to ensure correct replication of delayed delete of entire users
*       Always overwrite the seen DB on the replica with the full DB from the master on "setseen_all" to guarantee consistency
*       Sync all mailbox annotations, not just condstore, ensuring mailbox is consistent on both ends (solves POP3_NEW_UIDL bug)
