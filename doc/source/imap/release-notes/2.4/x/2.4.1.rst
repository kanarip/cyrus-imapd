Cyrus IMAP 2.4.1 Release Notes
==============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.0

*   Fix cyrdump to work with -C for alternate config
*   Change master to process all pending child messages once per loop, which fixes a DoS situation if there is too much message churn in a slower box - thanks to Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>
*   Reconstruct added flags -R, -U, -o, -O to give options handling corrupt or missing files
*   Reconstruct fixed a pile of bugs, including a nasty one which created mailboxes with a UIDVALIDITY of 0
*   Fixed EXPUNGE in murder
*   Fixed LSUB where subscribed mailboxes are on different murder backends
*   New build system using git commit ID rather than CVS date information to uniquely identify a release or development build via the "ID" command. Also changes the CYRUS_VERSION string for builds directly from git.
