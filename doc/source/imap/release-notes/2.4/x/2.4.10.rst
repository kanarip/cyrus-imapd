Cyrus IMAP 2.4.10 Release Notes
===============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.9

*   fixed handling of unparsable emails during append (which would cause invalid cyrus.index records otherwise)
*   quota: fix a pile of bugs. #1801, virtdomain support; #2728, slow user delete; #3178, "file name too long" with big mailbox names; #3179, quota -f doubles usage.
*   Bug #3043 - parse multiple groups in headers correctly
*   Bug #3158 - lmtp backend connection timeout
*   Bug #3223 - limit MIME parsing depth to avoid stack overflows
*   Bug #3273 - add SORT=DISPLAY support (but note: still questions about correctness of unicode sorting)
*   Bug #3504 - convert all sieve scripts to \r\n line endings on upload
*   Bug #3402 - options to munge 8bit characters in headers during lmtp delivery to avoid backscatter
*   sync_client: fix broken keepalive TCP options (I doubt anyone ever tried to use it)
*   Bug #3482 - add "-o" option to ipurge to only purge messages with \Deleted flag set
