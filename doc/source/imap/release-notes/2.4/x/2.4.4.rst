Cyrus IMAP 2.4.4 Release Notes
==============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.3

*   Fixed sync_reset handling of user deletions
*   Fixed proc file handling of LOGIN and folder unselect
*   use cyrus.expunge file (if still present) to delete bogus records from a failed index upgrade (cause by bugs in earlier version)
*   detect version 2.5 in XFER to support use with master git branch in a murder
*   made pop3 expunge much more efficient
*   handle missing seen file in XFER
