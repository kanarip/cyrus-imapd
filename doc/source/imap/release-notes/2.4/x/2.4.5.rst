==============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.4

*   Tidy up of the git version number added to the ID response
*   Fixed incorrect time field in date searches (Bug #3339) - thanks Greg Banks for noticing this one

*   Made all perl utilities use /usr/bin/perl in the #! line (Bug #2275) - reported by Yann Rouillard over 5 years ago!
*   Fixed crash on message with incomplete final boundary (Bug #3345) - found at FastMail by Bron Gondwana
*   Regression: sync_crc was being set to 00000000 on repack - introduced in 2.4.4 (Bug #3347) - first found at FastMail, but also seen at multiple other sites
