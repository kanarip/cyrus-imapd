Cyrus IMAP 2.4.6 Release Notes
==============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.5

*   Fixed Bug #3370 - corruption on OpenBSD and other systems without a reliable mmap
*   Fixed Bug #3360 - race condition which could lose seen data on XFER with upgrade
*   Lots of documentation updates
*   Fixed Bug #3355 - added an option to suppress items from the capability response (and bug #3356 when the first attempt was buggy)
*   Fixed Bug #3357 - crash when calling ctl_mboxlist on mailboxes with annotations
*   Fixed Bug #3369 - crash when undumping mailbox during XFER
*   Fixed Bug #3361 - shared folders not listing in LSUB "" % - only with unixheirsep and altnamespace
*   Fixed Bug #3362 - "too many open files" when doing XFER of a user with too many sub mailboxes. Makes XFER less "atomic", but now it works, which is good!
