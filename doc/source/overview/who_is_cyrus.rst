Who Is Cyrus
============

The Cyrus project was originally started at `Carnegie Mellon University`_ but it has since attracted a very dedicated and diverse group of core contributors. Carnegie Mellon University remains active in development of Cyrus and also provides the infrastructure on which cyrusimap.org runs today, but CMU is now just one of many core contributors to Project Cyrus.
